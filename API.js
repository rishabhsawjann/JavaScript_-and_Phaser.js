/*
what is an API
API=Application Programming Interface
It's like a set of rules that allows two programs to
talk to each other.
You donâ€™t need to know how the other program works internally,
 you just use the rules (the API).

xample: Think of an electric socket.

You donâ€™t need to know how electricity is made.

You just plug your charger in (follow the rules of the socket), and it works.

The socket is the API between your device and the power company.

What are Web APIS?
Web APIs are APIs made for websites.

They help your JavaScript code communicate with the browser or
with other services on the internet

Two main types of Web APIS:
Browser APIs (built-in, come with the browser)

These let your JS code interact with the browser itself.

Examples:

DOM API â†’ change the web page (add/remove text, images, colors).

Storage API â†’ save data on the userâ€™s computer
 (like saving login info).

Geolocation API â†’ get userâ€™s location.

Media API â†’ work with audio/video.

ðŸ‘‰ You donâ€™t need to install anything.
 They are already inside Chrome, Firefox, etc.
