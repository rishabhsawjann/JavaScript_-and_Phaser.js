//How do we use sort in JS
/*
JS has a built in sort method used to arrange
the elements of an array and returns
reference to the sorted array.
No copy is made because the elements are sorted
in the same place*/

//array.sort (compareFuntion);//syntax:

const fruits=["Banana","Apple","kela","sab"];
fruits.sort();
console.log(fruits);
