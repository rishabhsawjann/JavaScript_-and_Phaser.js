// let see how can we remove properties form an object:
 // there are several ways to remove properties from an object
 // with the delete operator being the most straightforward
 // commonly used method.
 
 // when we use delete, it removes the selected property from the 
 // object. Here's, an exmple of how to use the delete operator:

 const person={
    name:"Rishabh",
    age:30,
    job:"Engineer",
 };
 
 delete person.job;
 console.log(person.job);


 //Now let's check how to see if the object has property:
 const name=
 {
    id:rishabh,
    age:23,

 };
