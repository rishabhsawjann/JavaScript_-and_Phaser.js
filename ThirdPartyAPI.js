/*
Third-party APIs (external, from companies/websites)

These come from other platforms. 

You need internet + their code or documentation to use them.

Examples:

Google Maps API → show maps on your site.

Weather API → get live weather updates.

Payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal) → handle payments.

Social Media APIs (Twitter, Instagram) → fetch posts, likes, etc.

Why are APIs important?

They give extra powers to your website.

Without APIs, your website would only show static text/images.

With APIs, your site can store data, show maps,

fetch weather, play media, and connect with services.


In Super simple words:
API are tools that let your website talk to the browser or
other services to to powerful things(like using maps,weather,storage,
payments)
